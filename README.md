# rnm-login-app

React Node.js MySQL login web app

Web application base with authenticated user login and registration. Hosted on Heroku cloud.

### Note 6.12.2019:

Contains a lot of old code with not-so-best practices, but login and signup works fine so going to leave it like this for now, as an older example project of mine.

# How to run

-Install npm dependencies in root and client folder

-Run
`npm run both`
in root folder - this uses concurrently to run start scripts with one command in root folder (backend) with nodemon, and second command in client folder (frontend).

-Browser will open local dev environment at "localhost:3000"
